    "The preceding examples probably gave you some idea of the many options pandas gives you for performing fairly complex operations on your data with only a few commands. As you might expect, this level of functionality is also available for aggregating data. In this section, I walk through a few simple examples of aggregating data to illustrate some of the many possibilities. Although many options are available, I focus on merging data frames, performing simple data aggregation, and grouping and filtering.\n",
